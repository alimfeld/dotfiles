# Dotfiles

Configurations to improve the CLI dev experience.

Core tools:

- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
- [Z Shell (zsh)](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Supporting TUIs:

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/)

## üìÅ XDG Base Directory

The dotfiles try to leverage and follow the XDG Base Directory specification.

Since zsh only offers partial support for XDG, we still have a `.zshenv` in the
home directory.

## üîå Plugins

Use of plugins in core tools is reduced to a minimum. Since plugins are
specific to the respective tool, the tools are configured in a way to have
those plugins auto-installed.

**Z Shell** plugins are listed in `.zshrc` and are automatically installed (and
loaded) when the shell starts. The following functions are defined to manage
plugins:

- `zsh-plugins-install`
- `zsh-plugins-update`
- `zsh-plugins-remove`

**Neovim** is configured to use [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
for installing and managing plugins.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Key Bindings

Z Shell and tmux are setup with vi key bindings.

The tmux prefix is `<Ctrl-Space>` following the leader key `<Space>` used in
Neovim.

`<Ctrl-h>`, `<Ctrl-j>`, `<Ctrl-k>` and `<Ctrl-l>` can be used to seamlessly
navigate between Neovim and tmux splits using
[vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator).

## üìã Clipboard

Z Shell uses
[zsh-system-clipboard](https://github.com/kutsan/zsh-system-clipboard) to
synchronize the system clipboard with ZLE buffers.

Neovim sets the `clipboard` option to `unnamedplus` to yank and paste to/from
the system clipboard.

Tmux uses terminal features to synchronize copied text with the system
clipboard. See [tmux wiki](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Clipboard) for
details.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tmux Sessions

To start and switch to tmux sessions based on directories under '~/dev', the
`tmux-sessionizer` script is used. This script is heavily inspired by
[ThePrimagen's
tmux-sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer)

The script is started from zsh using the `<Ctrl-Space>` key binding. From tmux
it's invoked using `<Ctrl-Space Tab>`.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The dotfiles assume the following additional packages to be installed on your
system:

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

You can install them using your systems's package manager or via
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

The dotfiles can be installed using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alimfeld/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow */
```
